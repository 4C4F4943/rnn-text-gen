Dashing through the snow
On a one-horse open sleigh,
Over the fields we go,
Laughing all the way;
Bells on bob-tail ring,
Making spirits bright,
What fun it is to ride and sing
A sleighing song tonight
Jingle bells, jingle bells,
Jingle all the way!
O what fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh

A day or two ago,
I thought I'd take a ride,
And soon Miss Fanny Bright
Was seated by my side;
The horse was lean and lank;
Misfortune seemed his lot;
He got into a drifted bank,
And we, we got upsot.
Jingle Bells, Jingle Bells,
Jingle all the way!
What fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh.

A day or two ago,
The story I must tell
I went out on the snow
And on my back I fell;
A gent was riding by
In a one-horse open sleigh,
He laughed as there
I sprawling lie,
But quickly drove away.
Jingle Bells, Jingle Bells,
Jingle all the way!
What fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh.

Now the ground is white
Go it while you're young,
Take the girls tonight
And sing this sleighing song;
Just get a bob-tailed bay
Two-forty as his speed
Hitch him to an open sleigh
And crack! you'll take the lead.
Jingle Bells, Jingle Bells,
Jingle all the way!
What fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh.


Jingle bell, jingle bell, jingle bell rock
Jingle bells swing and jingle bells ring
Snowin' and blowin' up bushels of fun
Now the jingle hop has begun

Jingle bell, jingle bell, jingle bell rock
Jingle bells chime in jingle bell time
Dancin' and prancin' in Jingle Bell Square
In the frosty air

What a bright time, it's the right time
To rock the night away
Jingle bell time is a swell time
To go glidin' in a one-horse sleigh

Giddy-up jingle horse, pick up your feet
Jingle around the clock
Mix and a-mingle in the jinglin' feet
That's the jingle bell rock

Jingle bell, jingle bell, jingle bell rock
Jingle bell chime in jingle bell time
Dancin' and prancin' in Jingle Bell Square
In the frosty air

What a bright time, it's the right time
To rock the night away
Jingle bell time is a swell time
To go glidin' in a one-horse sleigh

Giddy-up jingle horse, pick up your feet
Jingle around the clock
Mix and a-mingle in the jinglin' feet
That's the jingle bell
That's the jingle bell
That's the jingle bell rock

Christmas, Christmas time is here,
And Christmas songs you love to hear
Thoughts of joy and hope and cheer,
But mostly shopping, shopping, shopping

Christmas, Christmas time is here,
The sleigh bells and the red-nosed deer
Songs and songs we love to hear
All played a thousand times each year

Heard this same song twenty times
And it's only Halloween (Joy To The World)
(I saw three ships come sailing in on Christmas Day on Christmas Day)
It's not even cold outside (deck the halls with boughs of holly)

Christmas, Christmas time is here,
(Hark The Herald Angels Sing)
And Christmas songs you love to hear
(Joy To The World)
Thoughts of joy and hope and cheer,
But mostly shopping, shopping, shopping

Christmas season
Starting sooner every year
It's October,
Stores with plastic Christmas trees

Ransack the mall,
Shop 'til you lose your mind
Spike the eggnog,
Sit back and watch Rudolph, Frosty, Tiny Tim, and Scrooge, the Grinch, or Charlie Brown

It's time...

It's time to do the Christmas can-can
If you can't, can't dance, well, that's OK (not going to do the kick line)
All you need is a tree, some lights about a thousand presents
Wrap them up and pray for snow

Run to your closet
Find your Christmas sweater
Screaming carols all the way (fa-la-la-la-la)
Maine all the way to California it's the Christmas can-can Halloween to Christmas day

It's the most wonderful time of year
We're running mad with Christmas cheer
Hey, what's troubling you, my friend?
It's not fair if you're Jewish, Jewish (not fair if you're Jewish, Jewish)

Dreidel, Dreidel, Dreidel
I made it out of clay
You realize that Christmas ain't the only holiday

Hey, he's right who made these laws?
Look! Wait! Here comes Santa Claus, Santa Claus, Santa Claus, Santa Claus, Santa Claus (Santa, Santa, Santa, Santa, Santa, Santa, Santa, Santa) (Guys? Guys!)

Hey, Santa do the can-can
Help them if you can-can
Join in the parade
(I'm gonna go grab some Chinese food)
All you need is a tree, some lights about a thousand presents
Wrap them up and pray for snow

Run to your closet
Find your Christmas sweater
Screaming carols all the way (fa-la-la-la-la)
France all the way to Indiana
It's the Christmas can-can
That's the end

Wait for our ending
We should share this holiday
Hava Nagila happy Hanukkah to you,
A happy Hanukkah to you, a happy Hanukkah to you
A merry Christmas, Hanukkah and also Kwanzaa.
Merry Christmas, happy Hanukkah, and merry Kwanzaa, too
